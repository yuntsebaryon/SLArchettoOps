\title{\textbf{LAr Filter Regeneration Procedure}}
\author{Yun-Tse Tsai}
\date{\today}

\maketitle

%-------------------------------------------------------------------
\underline{General steps:}
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength\itemsep{-0.2em}
\item Preheat the LAr filter to 175 -- 180{\dC} with ultra high purity Ar gas at 160~slpm 
($\sim$6.7~scfm on the flowmeter).  
It takes about 3~hours.  
Regarding the voltage of the gas heater, you can start with 55~V at the variac and bump it 
to 100 -- 110~V after everything is stable for 10~minutes.  
You can stop preheating when the bottom thermocouple reaches $\sim$145{\dC}.
Currently we are using the ultra high purity Ar from the gas port of the LAr dewar, 
because a huge amount of gas Ar is needed.
\item Use 1 -- 2\% {\Hydro} balanced with Ar to regenerate the LAr filter.  
Keep the temperature between 175 and 225{\dC}.  
With the flow rate of 80~slpm ($\sim$3.3~scfm on the flowmeter), we expect to use 5 gas cylinders, 
each takes about 1.25 hours.  
You can keep the voltage of the gas heater between 55 -- 75~V (at the variac).
\item Cool down the system with ultra high purity Ar gas.  
This take $\sim$80~minutes and you will sort of uniformly ramp down the voltage of 
the gas heater from 65~V to 20~V.
\end{enumerate}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------
\underline{Time to stop regeneration:}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{-0.2em}
\item Humidity plateaus.  Better plateaus at 0.02\%.
\item 5 hours of 2\% {\Hydro} gas at 80~slpm ($\sim$3.3~scfm on the flowmeter).
\item Temperature in the LAr filter does not rise anymore.
\end{itemize}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------
\underline{Safety:}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{-0.2em}
\item All the doors of the LNTF hut have to be open.
\item The intake fan has to be turned on.
\item The oxygen deficiency sensor and monitor (ODM) have to be checked.
\item The pressure in the LAr filter is shown on PG3.
\item The gas flow has to be greater than 2~scfm (marked on the flowmeter) to prevent the heater 
from getting too hot.
\item The gas heater power cord is plugged into the heater engineering control (EEIP approved), 
which shut down the power if the temperature
of the gas heater exceeds the preset value, 355{\dC}.  
The shut-down temperature can be set at the detector control GUI (Ignition),
and the gas heater temperature is displayed in the same page.
\item When sealed, the pressure of the LAr filter and gas pipe should not exceed 150~psig.
The pressure relief valve on the LAr filter will open at $\sim$150~psig,
while the pressure relief valves along the pipe will open at 150 -- 200~psig.
\item If seeing smoke or smelling something unusual, shut down the variac power supply (heater) 
and investigate.
\end{itemize}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------
\underline{Technical notes:}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{-0.2em}
\item V3, V5, V6, V16/V17, V18/V19 isolate the LAr filter.  
During the regeneration, V3, V5, and V6 should be always closed.  
V17 and V18 are metal valves, which will be always open.
We will rely on V16 and V19 to 
isolate the LAr filter, instead of V17 and V18.
However, we close V17 after regeneration to prevent cold Ar from entering
the gas heater when filling LAr.
\item V16, V20, V21, V22, V24, V25 are diaphrame valves and are not adjustable.
When opening them, make a full open.
Use Reg1/2/3 and V19 to control the flow rate.
\item The Ar gas flows from the gas port of the LAr dewar, Reg3, V20, V16, HT1, V17, into the LAr filter, 
and vents from V18, V19, FC1, outside the LNTF hut along the venting pipe, as shown in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:ArFlow}.
\item The 2\%{\Hydro}+Ar gas flows from the gas cylinders, Reg1/2, V26/V27, V22, V16, HT1, V17, 
into the LAr filter, 
and vents from V18, V19, FC1, outside the LNTF hut along the venting pipe, 
as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:H2Flow}.
\item The vacuum vessel surrounding the LAr filter should be evacuated from V4 all the time 
during regeneration.  
The pressure can be read from PG6.
\item Control Reg1/2/3 and V19 carefully to avoid compromising the LAr filter.  
We want the LAr filter to have pressure 
greater than the atmosphere so that the air won't diffuse in, but not too overpressurized.  
16 -- 35~psia in the LAr filter is good.
% {\color{orange} We would like to get rid of V17 and V18, but if they are needed in this process, 
% please follow up.}
\item The pressure at the outlet of Reg3 and in the LAr filter should be very close to each other,
because the pressure drop along the inlet line is small.
\item The pressure at the outlet of Reg1/2 is a few psi higher then the pressure in the LAr filter,
which corresponds to the pressure drop along the inlet line. 
\item We should always keep the gas flow (Ar or 2\%{\Hydro}+Ar) between 2 and 6.7~scfm 
(marked on the flowmeter).
\item Maintain the catalyst temperature between about 175{\dC} and 225{\dC}.
\item Do NOT exceed 225{\dC}, even though 250{\dC} may be tolerated.
% \item If we keep the gas flow at 6.7~scfm Air, a gas cylinders should be finished in about an hour.
\item The temperature of the hot gas and heater body may increase while the voltage 
from the variac power supply is fixed.  
It is owing to the drop of the gas flow.  We can adjust Reg1/2 to cope with this situation.
This happens all the time with the 2\%{\Hydro}+Ar cylinders and we should keep an eye on 
these parameters.
\item The humidity sensor operates between -20{\dC} and 50{\dC}.
With the Ar flow rate of 160~slpm ($\sim$6.7~scfm on the flowmeter), the hot Ar gas likely 
still has higher temperature than 50{\dC} when it arrives the humidity sensor.
The humidity sensor will show 0\% all the time in this case.
It will start functioning when the temperature drops.
We can turn off the gas heater or lower the flow rate to obtain colder gas when we need to
check the humidity.
(Modification is being planned.)
\item The LED light on the gas heater control may be broken.  The controlling part 
should be functional, and you just have to follow the labels for the toggle switch.
\item The torque for V17 is 4~foot-pound, 3/4" socket.
\item The torque for V18 is 21.7 foot-pound, 3/4" socket (not needed, just FYI).  
Need different torque wrenches for V17 and V18 typically.
