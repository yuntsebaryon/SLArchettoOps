Notes:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{-0.2em}
\item All the doors of the LNTF hut have to be open, the intake fan has to be turned on, and oxygen deficiency sensor and monitor (ODM) have to be checked.
\item V3, V5, V6, V9, V18 isolate the LAr filter.  During the LAr filling, V5, V9, and V18 should be always closed.
\item V12, V13, V14 (V15, V16, V17) isolate the SLArchetto vessel.  V13 and V16 should be always closed, while V14 should be always open until the very end of the LAr filling.
\item After connecting a new LAr supply dewar, purge the air in the tube from V2.
\item At the beginning of LAr filling, LAr evaporates in the LAr filter.  Purge the gas Ar from V10 because the LAr filter doesn't filter gas Ar, and this gas Ar will contaminate the LAr in SLArchetto in the end.
\item When starting filling LAr in SLArchetto (at the room temperature), all the LAr will evaporate.  This is the time that pressure will build up in the system.  Carefully control V15 to release the pressure.
\item Keep the pressure in the SLArchetto vessel at 2 -- 4~psig (16.5 -- 18.5~psia).
\item The torque for V3 and V17 is 25 foot-pound.
\item RTD2 (the bottom one) is not available in this run, but it is repetitive to RTD1.
\item RTD3 in this run is connected to Cryocon channel B.
\item Take LArPix data during filling (but after the vessel is at $\ge$ atmospheric pressure).
\item Turn off the LArPix tile before ramping up the high voltage.
\end{itemize}
